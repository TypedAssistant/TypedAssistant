# Home Assistant Configuration

This application requires two environment variables to be set: `HASS_SERVER` and `HASS_TOKEN`.

- `HASS_SERVER`: This should be the URL of your Home Assistant server. For example, `http://192.168.1.99:8123`.

- `HASS_TOKEN`: This is the API token generated from your Home Assistant instance. You can generate this token from your Home Assistant profile page. Please ensure to keep this token secure as it provides full access to your Home Assistant instance.

Please ensure these environment variables are set before running the application.
